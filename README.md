# Data-recovery-tool
This tool is used to recover deleted files by scanning disks for hidden data fragments and reassembling them into usable files before the raw data is overwritten by new information.

Overview
This tool is used to recover deleted files by scanning a disk image for hidden data fragments and intelligently reassembling them into usable files before the raw data is overwritten. It supports recovery for JPG, PNG, PDF and WAV files from disk images using file signature carving compression and entropy-based analysis.

Features
Signature-based recovery for popular formats (JPG, PNG, PDF, WAV)

Entropy scanning to detect possible fragmented or hidden regions

Saves recovered files in a dedicated output directory

Handles truncated, corrupted, and partially overwritten files

Usage
Place your disk image file (e.g., leo_disk.img) in the working directory.

Run the script:

bash
python your_scriptname.py
Recovered files will be saved in the recovered folder. The console will show stats for recovered files by type.

Requirements
Python 3

No external dependencies (uses only standard Python modules)

How It Works
The tool scans the raw disk image for known file signatures.

Uses sliding entropy window to identify regions with high randomness typical of compressed formats.

Extracts files matching headers and footers, checks for corruption, and avoids duplicates using hashes.

Supports recovery for: JPG, PNG, PDF and WAV.

Limitations
Works on raw disk imagesâ€”does not modify the source disk.

Cannot recover data that has already been fully overwritten.

Accuracy depends on fragmentation and overall disk state.

Open-source under your chosen license (e.g., MIT, GPL).
